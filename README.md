# weather-app

# Technology used
* Vuejs 2
* Bootstrap vue ( Because i have more control on the ui/ux side)
* Pug (Easier to write and read than traditional html)
* Font-awesome Icons
* Lodash (Used the functions for filtering)
* https://wirefreethought.github.io/geodb-cities-api-docs/ This api used for searching places
* https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 this api for weather forecast
* I have also added extra stuff like sun, moon, clouds and rain to give users better visualization.
